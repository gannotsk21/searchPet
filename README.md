# searchPet

Format to use: main.java input.txt
I'm assuming that there will only be a max of 2 search parameters.

To add adoption features I would probably just add it as another part of the pet object. 

Share your thoughts on testing (unit &amp; integration) the application you just built.
Some things I would test more is the speed of the whole application. If processing a lot of data, this app would be pretty slow because of having to create each object each time the app is run.
